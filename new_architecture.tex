\section{Cache solutions}

\subsection{Solution}

The figure \ref{fig:req_amount} shows the amount of requests and time that browser needs to make to generate a single VMO and  render a page. The browser needs to make more than 20 AJAX requests for a single page. The middleware was deployed on the local machine meaning that there is no latency bentween browser and middleware server. As can be seen, these are not optimistic numbers. The amount of requests is too high and computation have to be done on the both client and server sides. Several questions arises:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is Redis a good caching layer for this project?
	\item Can Redis be replaced by something else? Maybe it would be better to use the configurational cache, represented by the web caches and control it through the http cache control headers.
\end{itemize}

The client application will make http requests through a reversed proxy server. The proxy sever will decide if the content is stale or not and will act as a web cache. The benefit of this solution is that instead of contacting server and than caching the object, the cache is contacted first and than the server. It theory it should give the performance and flexibility. The redis cache could be replaced by the Content Delivery Network solution in future.

\subsection{Web cache selection}

The web cache for the project should satisfy several parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Configurable. The client application sends requests both for DMOs and for writing user actions. The web cache should not cache the requests for writing user actions. The sessions still should be supported in order to write user actions. 
	\item Responsive, easy maintanable. The web cache should be deployed easily and provide statistics and internal logging. 
	\item High performance. The web cache should be transparent and must not increase the request time and latency if the cache object was not found locally.

\end{itemize}

There are a many web cache solutions available both commercial and open source. For this project only open source solutions were considered. The initial candidates were: Squid, Varnish, Apache server with proxy module, Nginx server as a cachable reversed proxy and Apache Traffic Server.

The Squid server is a forward proxy server, but it can be configured as a reversed proxy server. Squid is preferably used for storing static content.

The Varnish was developed as a reversed proxy server from the beginning. It is fast, reliable and lightweigth. It uses Varnish Configuration Language(VCL) for configuration and describing the data workflow in cache. The VCL is translated to the C code and compiled to a shared object which is then dynamically linked into the server process. It is powerful tool that helps to set up Varnish as a dynamic reverse proxy server.

The Apache traffic server was developed by the Yahoo group and moved eventually to the Apache Incubator \cite{GuApacheTrafficUri}. According to Yahoo inc. Apache traffic server can handle more than 400TB of internet traffic per day and works as a forward as well as reversed proxy server. It has a growing community and continous improvement. The configuration is simple and consists of changing several files. All these, makes Apache traffic server a good candidate.  

Other solutions(Nginx and Apache server) was not developed to be proxy servers, but have additional modules that one can install and configure. They are not well-configured and work worst than solutions described above \cite{GuApacheTrafficUri}[change].

The thorough comparison and performance evaluation of Varnish and Apache Traffic Server could be found in \cite{VarnApacheReverse}.

\subsection{Web cache configuration}

Before performing execution and comparative study reversed proxy servers should be properly configured. They should aggregate and store requests that contain public data and skip analytical requests and requests with private user information(e.g. payments).

Proxy servers should also work with http sessions. Usually, when session is specified(the set-cookie http header included in the server response), proxy servers are transparent, meaning they are skipping these requests and not store them in memory. As was described in previous chapters, the metadata server uses http session for analytical purposes. It means that even anonymous users will have the unique session. 

In order to solve the problem, the Varnish was configured to replace Cookie header with X-Cookie header. This gives the possibility for Varnish to store the requests and still have the analytical requests available. The metadata server was modified in order to treat X-Cookie header as a Cookie header.   

The Varnish configuration is presented in Appendix A.

The Apache traffic server did not require a specific configuration. 

\subsection{Testing tools}

In order to conduct necessary experiments the folowing tools were selected: Apache Benchmark tool and JMeter.

% Apache Benchmark tool serves as a lo 

JMeter is a tool that helps to measure the performance of applications that are using HTTP protocol. Jmeter was configured in order to simulate JSON and HTML requests that are required to render single page. The figure of Jmeter configuration is presented in Appendix B \ref{fig:jmeter_conf}. 
JMeter also builds the plot and the table of the request that was made with the corresponding time parameters.

Apache benchmark is a good tool for evaluating a performance of the developed solution. It emulate the user requests and execute multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.   

\subsection{Performance Comparison of Redis and Web caches}

% describe jmeter configuration

During the project several experiments were conducted. First, the figure [add figure of node.js jmeter] shows the results of executing JMeter script for existing company solution. The meaning of the columns is described below: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Label  -- The name of the script that was executed
	\item Samles -- The amount of responses that was executed
	\item Average -- The average response time, represented in milliseconds
	\item Min -- the minimum time for the response 
	\item Max -- the maximum time for the response
	\item Std. Dev.  -- standard deviation from the average response time
	\item Error -- the persentage of error responses
	\item Throughput -- the throughput represented in responses per second
	\item KB/sec -- the data transferred per second
	\item Avg. Bytes -- the amount of bytes transferred per response
\end{itemize}
